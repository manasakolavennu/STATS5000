Introduction
An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct shortly, either worldwide or in a particular area. Endangered species may be at risk due to factors such as habitat loss, poaching, genetic variation, and invasive species.
Extinction is a natural process in the wild. But the standard rate is about five species per year. The current extinction rate is over 12 species a day, which means we’re losing far more animals than ever recorded throughout history. If we continue in the same way, 30%–50% of animals will be extinct within the next 30 years. AccordingtotheInternationalUnionforConservationofNature’sRedListof Threatened Species, over 26,500 species are in danger of extinction. This includes 40 percent of amphibians, 34 percent of conifers, 33 percent of reef-building corals, 25 percent of mammals, and 14 percent of birds. In the U.S., over 1,600 species are listed as threatened or endangered.
A species is classified as endangered when its population has declined between 50 and 70 percent and as when its population is restricted to less than 250 mature individuals. When a species’ population is this low, its area of occupancy is not considered. There are now a total of 41,415 species on the IUCN Red List, and 16,306 of them are endangered species threatened with extinction. This is up from 16,118 compared to last year.
Species disappear because of changes to the earth that are caused either by nature or by the actions of people. Sometimes a natural event, like a volcano erupting, can kill an entire species. Other times, extinction will happen slowly as nature changes our world. For example, after the Ice Ages, when the glaciers melted and the earth became warmer, many species died because they could not live in a warmer climate. Newer species that could survive in a warmer environment took their places.
People can also cause the extinction of plants and animals. The main reason that many species are endangered or threatened today is because people have changed the homes or habitats upon which these species depend. A habitat includes not only the other plants and animals in an area, but all the things needed for the species' survival -- from sunlight and wind to food and shelter. The United States has many habitats, from ocean beaches to mountain tops. Every species requires a certain habitat in order to live. A cactus, for example, needs the sunny, dry desert in order to grow. A polar bear, on the other hand, would not live in a desert, because it could not find enough food and water.
Many people think fish declines are just the result of overfishing. But the increasing chemical and plastic pollution is a “significant” contributor to the decline of fish and other aquatic organisms. The use of chemicals, which has increased over the last couple of decades, is likely to grow further in the coming years, and their effect will be exacerbated by a changing climate, the report warns. An estimated 80% of chemical pollution in the seas originates on land, but historically regulation of water pollutants has focused on end-of-pipe discharges, and diffuse emissions of toxic chemicals, particularly in the aquatic environment.
